# Workflow
The project uses [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow.

Pull requests should be opened to develop/feature branches.

Versions have a GitHub Project with the planned new features. These should be
as compact as possible, while making sure the implemented parts are not half
functional. These may be appended with additional features if someone wants to
work on something specific, not already in the plans.

# Code styling
All new code should be 4 space indented, major sections should be commented.
